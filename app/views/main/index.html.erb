    <h2>Balmain and Balmain</h2>

    <h3>Traditional handmade furniture</h3>
    <p>Balmain &amp; Balmain was founded over twenty years ago, in rural Dorset, to design, create and sell the finest quality bespoke furniture. Since that time, we have steadily evolved into one of the UKâ€™s leading suppliers of bespoke upholstered furniture. With our flexible approach, we embrace both contemporary and more traditional, classic designs.
